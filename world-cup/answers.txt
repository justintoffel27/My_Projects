Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Didn't have any predictions, but as simulations increased, the time increased.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 3-5 Times to get an average
